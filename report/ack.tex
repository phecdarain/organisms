We would like to acknowledge all the other groups in the class for really insightful 
discussions, particularly group 6 for introducing a farming based strategy, on which 
our Pattern-Maker brain was partially based upon. We acknowledge the "Sheep" reference 
organism for drastically changing our perception about this game.
