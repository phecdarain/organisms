\subsection{Other Implementation Highlights}
\textbf{Directions.} Instead of directly store and use the direction constant 
given by the simulator, we have a private lib which is essentially built on an array 
representation of the four directions. 
The most important advantage is that we can use for loop when we need to check all directions
instead of having a switch and handle each direction individually.
This makes our code much more compact and make it easy to have util-functions like check if there 
is food(enemy) around, left, right, reverse of a given direction, etc.
