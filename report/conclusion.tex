\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Our ultimate findings can be summarized in two statements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiplayer strategies tend to perform better when they are initially-aggressive ultimately-conservative behavior-based organisms, and
\item Single-player boards are best played using a structural approach which measures and adjusts according to board variables.
\end{enumerate}

We found it difficult to combine the two strategies into an organism which detects board conditions and responds accordingly; however, we do believe that such a strategy is ultimately possible.  Nonetheless, it seems that the optimal single-player and multiplayer strategies are orthogonal to each other: without sophisticated detection and communication algorithms, an organism must choose to specialize to either a singleplayer or multiplayer role.

While we were not successful in combining the strategies, we were generally pleased with the success of our individual strategies.  The single-player oriented PatternMaker achieved \TODO{[INSERT PERCENTAGE HERE]} of the maximal potential board energy; meanwhile, the multi-player oriented Flood was able to outperform other organisms in its designed setup(win overwhelmingly on $50\times 50$ board). Moreover, it was able to frequently compete and succeed against multiple copies of the SurviveSheep organism simultaneously.

Throughout the project, we found that our strategies did change considerably, greatly aided by new perspectives gained through class discussions.  We found that frequently reconsidering our assumptions and approaching the problem from totally new perspectives was enormously helpful in moving forward.  Contrary to class sentiment, we felt that overarching strategy, not parameters, still accounted for the primary differences between organisms.
