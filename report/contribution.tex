\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contribution}
We list a few of our major contributions in the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item Analysis and calculate the maximal possible sustainable energy that could be achieved.
We use this analysis as a guidance when designing the PatternMaker single player strategy, i.e., the final goal of this strategy is to meet the theoretical energy maximum.
\item Design the communication protocol and mechanism between organism, experiment and conclude the limitation and inefficiency of communication based strategy.
\item Introduce the surviving stage, use probability analysis to evaluation the immediate best move for each round in order to survive the harsh condition in the beginning.
\item Discover the idea of allowing organism to switch role to either direction(aggressive or quiet) so as to achieve an ecosystem-like strategy. The resulted circulating virtual behavior successfully maintain the overall healthiness of the whole organism family.
    Allow the family the expand when having enough energy and being conservative under harsh condition.
\item Bring up the idea of make organism spare to each other instead of staying crowdedly together, which enable a much larger coverage of board with much less number of organism, which can sustain a much longer time.
\end{itemize}
